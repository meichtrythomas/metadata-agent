## Introduction

The Brand SDK is written in React and TypeScript. While we're committed to make it as easy to use as possible, at least some basic experience with React and TypeScript will be necessary to build with the Brand SDK.  
﻿

If you have no prior experience in React and/or TypeScript, there are many free education resources out there that can help you. Here are just a few of the popular ones:

*   ﻿[Official React site](https://reactjs.org/)﻿
    
*   ﻿[React course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react)﻿
    
*   ﻿[Official TypeScript site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)﻿
    
*   ﻿[TypeScript course on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=typescript)﻿
    

To pick up a draggable item, press the space bar. While dragging, use the arrow keys to move the item. Press space again to drop the item in its new position, or press escape to cancel.

## Node.js

To get up and running with the Brand SDK, you’ll need to have Node.js version 22 (or newer) installed. Node.js comes bundled with npm — its package manager — and npx, the npm package runner. You’ll need both to set up, run, and deploy your content block.

*   Learn more about Node.js and how to install it on the [official Node.js site](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/).

The Frontify command line interface (CLI) is a tool that lets you quickly create new Content Blocks and run commands related to Content Block development and deployment.

## React Developer Tools

The Brand SDK supports Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) for a better development experience. You need to have the React Developer Tools installed for it to work properly (and as a benefit, you can use the Dev Tools to inspect the component itself).

*   Learn more about the React Developer Tools for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) or for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/).

The final step is to create a Frontify account, which you need to preview your App and potentially deploy it to the Frontify Marketplace. Sign up for the Developer Sandbox [here](https://weare.frontify.com/r/d-vpAii5AyaA9o4dFG0Tfh5EzCO7zWS1UOLUI2eZJLo).

If you already have a Frontify account, you can of course skip this step.
