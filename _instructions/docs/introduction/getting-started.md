Welcome to the Frontify Developer Documentation, your resource for building integrations and customizations with Frontify. Here, you'll find the tools, frameworks, and resources needed to extend the power of Frontify and create seamless integrations with your team's favorite tools.

## Documentation structure

The documentation is organized into three main sections: Brand SDK, APIs, and Widgets.

### Brand SDK

Frontify Guidelines include around 40 pre-built Content Blocks like Color, Typography, and Image Grids. With the Brand SDK, you can create custom Content Blocks and Apps that integrate seamlessly with Frontify, enhancing your guidelines' functionality and providing a comprehensive developer experience.
